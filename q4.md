## Q4 

- Time Complexity while Training 
-- While training the time complexity of Logistic regression is O(Nd), where N is total number of samples and d is the total number of features of each sample. Update rules include matrix multiplication of X.T and errorY whose dimension are dxN and Nx1 respectively. Thus O(Nd). 

- Time Complexity while Predicting 
-- While predicting time complexity is O(d) per sample. Since after training we get a theta matrix of dimension dx1 and input vector is 1*d thus time complexity is 
O(d).

- Space Complexity while Training
-- For Logistic Regression we need to store X,y,thetas, bias. Thus to store X we need (Nxd), for y we need (Nx1), and thetas take (d) and bias takes O(1). Thus overall sapce complexity is O(Nd+N+d). 

- Space Complexity while Predicting
-- After training the model for prediction we only require thetas and bias thus overall space complexity is O(d)

NOTE: For Multiclass Logistic Regression above complexities will increase by a factor of O(k), where k represents number of classes. This increases because now we need to train separate weights and biases for each classes.
