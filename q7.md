- I choosed Jackal and Tiger as my classes and collected data accordingly.
- With baseline VGG1 I get an accuracy of 70% 
- With data augumentation applied of VGG1 I get an accuracy of around 80% which implies that when the data was augumented(in here same image was translated and rotated and was added to the training set) the model parameters learned more accuractly and thus increasing accuracy. 
- With transfer learning, we used already existing model VGG16 and then trained its last fully connected layer on our dataset. It gives an accuracy of 100% which is due to the fact that VGG16 in itself is very efficient model thus using the first model as the sub-model for our second classification task in addition training our dataset over last FCN layers improves the model's accuracy significantly.
